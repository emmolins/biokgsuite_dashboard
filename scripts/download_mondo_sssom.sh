# One-time download of MONDO's SSSOM crosswalk file.
#
# This file is ~30 MB and contains mappings between MONDO and external
# disease vocabularies (UMLS, OMIM, Orphanet, ICD9, NCIT, MESH, DOID, ...).
# load_matrix() consults it as the third disease-ID bridge so MATRIX disease
# nodes whose primary identifiers are UMLS/OMIM/etc. can still be canonicalised
# to bare MONDO numerics.
